       Good morning my name is Danilo Iringan, I am currently in the Quality Assurance track for YearUp. I did a couple of college tracks, unfortunately none of them ever felt right so I mostly have work experiences, such as customer server, teamwork, and advising skills in order to make the team work towards a common goal. 
        My key aspects are being vocal about and advocating the team to make sure everyone is on the same page, comparing and contrasting between work to make sure my team is learning the product and challenging them on why they think that way. Empowering the team to strive for success while still respecting everyone's different level of expectation within themselves. 
        The skills I need to work on are giving feedback whether it'd be negative or positive, the delivery and tone is something I really need to work on. It is in my best interest to uphold my team higher than they expect themselves because at the end of the day I want them to understand that we have more potential to be more than we expect within ourselves. 
        My current hobby right now is reviewing my investing notes I wrote down to pick up where I left off in my Investment journey, and the job type I am working towards is Project Management, Financial IT, Freelance Cyber Security, or Source Code my own Stock Trader Code.
        
            
        Thank you for your time, if you would like to connect this is my LinkedIn profile, I will be looking forward to connecting with you all.
